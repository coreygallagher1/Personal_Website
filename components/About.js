              <strong>Hi, I'm Corey,</strong> a Full Stack Software Engineer currently working at FlexTrade.
            </p>
            <p>
              I specialize in creating <em>efficient</em> and <em>scalable</em> applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having graduated from Marquette University, I hold degrees in both <span className="highlight">Computer Science</span> and <span className="highlight">Computational Mathematics</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
             I love to build things from scratch and see them come to life and try to scale them. My passion is creating applications that will profoundly impact people's lives in a positive way.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, I'm you can find me working out, golfing, traveling, or planning my next big project. Other passions I have are personal finance, investing, and real estate.
